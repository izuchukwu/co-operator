## Hello Operator

Co-operator is a starting point for playing with [Pocket Operator](https://www.teenageengineering.com/products/po), the [OP-1](https://www.teenageengineering.com/products/op-1), or anywhere you'd like a quick beat. It builds patterns using a matrix generator, first diving the grid into 2 or 4 quadrants, randomizing the contents of 2 selected master quadrants, and duplicating or mirroring the contents to the complimentary quadrants.

## Quick Start

Two ways to go:

- Go to [izuchukwu.co/co-operator](http://izuchukwu.co/co-operator)
- Clone & open `index.html`

## Contributing

Co-operator is written in [CoffeeScript](https://coffeescript.org) and built with the design prototyping tool [Framer](https://github.com/koenbok/Framer). If you're familiar with Framer or have [Framer Studio](https://framer.com), the whole repo is an extension-less Framer project. Clone or download it, rename the folder to `co-operator.framer` and dive right in. Development takes place on the `gh-pages` branch.
